# quiz--1

Answer the following question based on the code in this repository.  This program is compiled into an executable called silly. Suppose my aim was to compute the sum of first N numbers given N as the argument using processes and I did the following where the child returns the partial sum via the “exit” and parent retrieves it via “wait” (assume it works as shown. Assuming a monotonic assignment of PIDs starting from 1000 for the root, show how many processes get created as a tree when I invoke the command as “./silly 3”. What will be the summation? Is the logic correct.

You can compile this code using

```
g++ code.cpp -o silly
```
